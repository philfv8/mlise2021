        <h1>MLiSE 2021 Workshop</h1>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Software engineering (SE) </strong>is about  methodologies and techniques for building high quality software systems.  However, modern software&nbsp;systems are becoming larger and more complex. Many  of these systems are distributed and contain hundreds or even thousands of  individual components that interact and communicate with each other through  various interfaces. This not only complicates the process of software  development, but also makes it more difficult and challenging to ensure their  correctness and reliability. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, recent advances and novel <strong>machine  learning (ML) </strong>techniques deals with the development of methods that can automatically  or semi-automatically infer models from data. Although, ML has already  revolutionized numerous domains such as image recognition, translation and  healthcare, it is not yet extensively used in SE. The increasing demand and  interest in SE to improve quality, reliability, cost-effectiveness and the ability  to solve complex problems has led researchers to explore the potential and  applicability of<strong> ML in SE</strong>.  For example,  some emerging applications of ML for SE are source code generation from  requirements, automatically proving the correctness of software specifications,  providing intelligent assistance to developers, and automating the software  development process with planning and resource management.  Moreover, SE techniques and methodologies can  be used to improve the ML process (<strong>SE for ML</strong>).</p>
        <p> The interest in ML in SE is evident from the  exponential growth in the number of articles published on ML for SE in recent  years. This workshop aims at bringing together the SE, ML and data mining  community to work toward novel ML for SE methods, their underlying assumptions  and guarantees to allow researchers, practitioners and software engineers to  identify and adopt the suitable ML methods to improve SE processes and software  itself.  </p>
        <p> The workshop is open to research papers from  academia and the industry. The workshop works on a model of call for  papers, but also feature a small number of invited papers from top researchers  in the field.</p>
        <p><strong>Aim and Scope </strong></p>
        <p>This workshop provides  a place for researchers from two different fields to bring together both  theoretical developments and applications of ML in SE. ML can provide new  methods and insights to address various challenges in SE and vice versa. The main  goal is to identify and share ideas on new research directions for how SE can  benefit from ML that could ultimately generate profound impact on the SE  society. Collaboration of people from ML and SE fields will  offer new insights and results that can be applied in some of the research  lines under the umbrella of the main <span class="style2"><a href="https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/">ECML PKDD 2021 conference</a>.</span></p>
        <p>          The<strong> topics of interest </strong>for <em>Machine Learning in Software Engineering</em> (MLiSE) include, but are not limited to following: </p>
